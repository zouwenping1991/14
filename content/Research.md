As essential cofactors in approximately half of proteins, late transition metals such as zinc, iron, copper and manganese play important roles in all life processes. Zinc is the second most abundant transition metal in biology and is required for all known organisms. Dietary zinc levels affect gut microbiota bacterial community composition and pathogen resistance, but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Understanding the distributions of and how zinc levels change in the gut microbiota is crucial to elucidating these mechanisms. 

In collaboration with Dr. Melissa L. Zastrow, my research is focused on using cofactor-based fluorescent proteins as platforms for anaerobic metal ions detection.
